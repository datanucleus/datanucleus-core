    This package provides classes implementing caching within DataNucleus.
    There are 2 caches used internally :-
    <P>
        The first is within the PersistenceManager and is the <B>Level 1 Cache</B>. 
        There are 3 available implementations of a Level 1 Cache here :- <I>SoftRefCache</I>, 
        <I>WeakRefCache</I> and <I>HardRefCache</I>. They provide varying degrees of object 
        retention during the garbage collection process.
    </P>
    <P>
        The second is across multiple PersistenceManagers within the same PersistenceManagerFactory, 
        and is the <B>Level 2 Cache</B>. There is one implementation of a Level 2 Cache here :- 
        <I>DefaultLevel2Cache</I>. Alternatively, there are plugins for EHCache, SwarmCache, OSCache
        and Coherence products
