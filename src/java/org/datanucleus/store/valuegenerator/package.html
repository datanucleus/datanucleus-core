    Value Generation.
    This package provides a series of classes providing generation of values.
    The entry point is ValueGenerationManager which is used for creating and managing the 
    various ValueGenerators. All generators are known by a symbolic name and can
    be accessed from the ValueGenerationManager via that name once created. All ValueGenerators
    copy the JDO2 "javax.jdo.datastore.Sequence" interface method names and hence
    can be easily extended and implement that interface.
