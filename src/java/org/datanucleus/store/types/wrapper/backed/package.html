<BODY>
    Provides implementations of the "backed" wrappers for the mutable Second Class Objects (SCO's) that are 
    supported. All have a "backing store" allowing the contents to be sent to/retrieved from the datastore 
    when required. Please refer to section 6.3 of the JDO 1.0 spec.
    Also provides queueing so that optimistic transactions can be supported when used with the backing store.
    All "backed" wrappers extend the "simple" form of the wrapper in "org.datanucleus.sco.simple".
